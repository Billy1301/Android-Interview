## Can you name some of the key concepts of Google's Material Design guidelines?

(There are many "right" answers here).

* Bold, graphic, intentional visual design choices
* Deliberate color choices, edge-to-edge imagery, large-scale typography, and intentional white space
* Motion is meaningful and appropriate, serving to focus attention and maintain continuity
* Use of familiar tactile attributes helps users quickly understand the product/app
* Emphasis on user actions makes core functionality immediately apparent
* Colors and design creates hierarchy, meaning, and focus
