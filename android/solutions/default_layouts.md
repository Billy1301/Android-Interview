## What are some of the default layouts that are given to us by the Android Framework?

1. [Relative Layout:](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/layout/relative.html) Aligns child views relative to each other; positions are defined relative to sibling elements, for example, aligned to the bottom of, or to the right of.

2. [Linear Layout:](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/layout/linear.html) Aligns all child views in a single direction, vertically or horizontally. 

3. [Frame Layout:](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/FrameLayout.html) Loads children one above another, like cards inside a frame; Placement can be one above another or anywhere inside the frame. Position is assigned with the [android:layout_gravity](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/FrameLayout.LayoutParams.html#attr_android:layout_gravity) attribute.

4. [Table Layout:](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/layout/grid.html) A tabular layout with an arbitrary number of rows and columns, arranged as TableRow Objects.
