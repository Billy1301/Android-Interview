## List all of the methods that make up the Activity Lifecycle.

There are six main methods to list. They would be called in this exact order:
- `onCreate()`
- `onStart()`
- `onResume()`
- `onPause()`
- `onStop()`
- `onDestroy()`

**Bonus:** `onRestart()` - This one is called after user navigates **away** from the app and comes back to it, **before** your activity was destroyed.
Refer to the image below for the complete activity lifecycle!
